# Hangman-Game-JS
A hangman game made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

This project was made so that I can further practice manipulating the DOM. 
I know JavaScript pretty well and wanted to apply it onto real world use by creating something interactive.

Main things I learned/practiced:
1. Practice with creating multiple functions and making them work with one another.
2. Changing the display and visibility of an element on the DOM.
3. Breaking down a problem entirely, mapping it out, then typing the code for it.
4. Appending elements onto parents as children
